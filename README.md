I like my electricity supplier. If the price of electricity goes down, you can update your contract to get the better rate. This is nice. But to see if the rate has gone down, you need to go to a website. 

To automate this activity, this script scrapes the webpage for the latest rate, and it emails me if the rate is better than my contracted rate. I schedule this script to run daily.

Script updated Aug 4, 2018: Since the electricity website changed, I no longer need to use Selenium and a headless Chrome browser to fill out a form before scraping the result.
